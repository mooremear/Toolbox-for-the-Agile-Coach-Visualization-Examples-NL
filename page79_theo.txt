Tube Poll

Dropping balls in tubes is a fun way to visualize data. The tubes can be labeled. The colors of the balls could be used to have different meaning.

The possibilities are of course endless, but here are some examples:
Statistics: Where do bugs originate from? Once a bug has been fixed, drop a ball in corresponding tube.
Data: Each tube is a sprint. Each ball a Story Point.
Poll: Each tube represents a question. Green balls for yes, red balls for no.
Vote: “Refactor” - what class should be the target for the next hack attack?
