Fail Wall

Do you as a team want to create a safer environment for experimentation and learnings? Perhaps one way to shape your behavior in that direction could be to defuse the drama of failures, and instead celebrate them.

The rules of a “Fail Wall” is simple. Whenever you screw up or make a blunder, you describe what happened on a Post-it. You put it up on the Fail Wall and do a failure bow. Here, the other team members should applaud you for sharing something that probably presented a learning opportunity.

You are of course not allowed to put up Post-its on behalf of others.
