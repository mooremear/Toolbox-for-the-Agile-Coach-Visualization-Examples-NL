Task size < 1 day

When tasking (i.e. breaking down the work that needs to be performed to complete a User Story) donâ€™t stop splitting the tasks until each task can be completed within a day.

This policy makes it easier to see progress and bottlenecks. It also triggers deeper collaborative discussions during the planning sessions.

Furthermore, if you use Dotting, you know there is something fishy going on if a task starts collecting dots since no single task should have more than one dot.

If you use a Sprint Burndown, you can instead of summarizing hours summarize the number of tasks. Much faster!
