Stuff Collectors

Having a hard time finding the right colored Post-its? Do the pens seem to constantly disappear? Why not put up boxes beneath or beside the whiteboard where you can collect them. 

You can even add labels that at the same time will function as a legend, explaining the colors of the Post-its.

The boxes could be made out of cardboard and put up using adhesive tape. Or buy yourself shower storage baskets with suction cups, attaching them to the whiteboard itself or a nearby window.
