Activity Dice

When you start your Daily Stand-up, roll the Team Activity Dice. The dice will tell you what you should do together as a team today.

It could be having a joint lunch, clean up the team area and make it nicer, make a surprise visit to another team, go outside for a walk, organize a Rock-Paper-Scissor team battle tournament, do 100 push-ups together, make a new dice, afternoon break with ice cream, meditate together for 10 minutes, draw and discuss a Jimmy Card, delete old and obsolete bugs in your digital planning tool, or anything else you fancy doing as a team.
