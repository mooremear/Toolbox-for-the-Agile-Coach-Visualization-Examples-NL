Team Time Zone Clocks

Do you collaborate a lot with teams located in another office, in another time zone?

Having clocks on the wall showing the current time at the different offices is a classic way of making it easy to know the time for the different teams.

Another approach could be to put a poster behind your own clock on which you show what time of day it is at the other offices. From a quick glance you know if your far-away-friend is at work, still hasnâ€™t arrived or is done for the day.
